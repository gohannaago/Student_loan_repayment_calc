# Student_loan_repayment_calc

## Purpose
To calculate amount of repayment per month. I needed it because I am paying back for two plans simultaneously!

## Things to work on
Being simultaneously on plans 1, 2 and 4 is calculated based on the lower threshold plan, one payment being payed to both plans - but this is not implemented. [Described here](https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/what-you-pay)
